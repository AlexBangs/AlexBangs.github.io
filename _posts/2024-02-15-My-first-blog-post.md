I am so grateful that you, a human being is reading these words on the screen.
I am so excited to actually have a voice, a platform for diffuse my discoveries to the world.

One day, I can look back here nostalgically with the advancements I have made.
I did "create" a HTML website before, however, I was "following the motions".
But having autonomy is both terrifying and exciting.

Currently, as of 2/15 I am stressing over the following things:

1. Passing the Network+ Exam
2. Completing my Bachelor's Degree in Cybersecurity at WGU
3. [Become stronger than a 78 year old woman on my -~~Bench(180lbs)~~, Squat (413lbs), and Deadlift (360 lbs)

4. Finding what specialization of Cybersecurity I should focus on
5. Get a job in said specialization.
