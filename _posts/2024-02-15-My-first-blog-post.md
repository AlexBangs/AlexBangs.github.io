## This is my first blog post ever.

I am so grateful that you, a human being is reading these words on the screen.
I am so excited to actually have a voice, some platform for diffuse my discoveries to the world.

One day, I can look back here nostalgically with the advancements I have made.
I did "create" a HTML website before, however, I was "following the motions".
What will I post next? I am not sure.

But I am sure I will pass the Network+ Exam, current me is stressing over it.
